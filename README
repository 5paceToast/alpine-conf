Alpine Conf are a set of utilities for making backup of config files.

* The concept
Specify the files you want to backup in a list, /etc/backuplist. You can add
or delete entries in this list with the utilities lbu_add and lbu_delete.

To actually prform the backup, use the utility lbu_commit. The files can be
"commited" (backed up) to either floppy or usb.

For example:

  lbu_add /etc/networking/interfaces
  lbu_commit floppy


To install, run:

  make install
